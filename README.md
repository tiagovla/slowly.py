# Unofficial Async API for Slowly App

This project provides an **unofficial asynchronous API** for interacting with
the Slowly app. The Slowly app is a unique platform that connects people from
around the world via pen-pal style letters.

This repository offers Python classes and functions that allow you to interact
with Slowly in an asynchronous manner, making it easy to fetch letters,
retrieve user data, and perform other operations asynchronously.

## Installation

```bash
pip install slowly.py
```
